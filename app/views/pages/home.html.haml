    %p
      .skymapper-dropcap
      SkyMapper is a state-of-the-art automated wide field survey telescope that represents a new vehicle for scientific discovery.  It is sited under the dark skies of 
      %a{ href: 'http://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/siding-spring-observatory'} Siding Spring Observatory
      near Coonabarabran, in central NSW. SkyMapper's mission is to robotically create the first comprehensive digital survey of the entire southern sky. The result will be a detailed record of more than a billion stars and galaxies, to a sensitivity one million times fainter than the human eye can see. The survey's data set will be made freely available to the scientific and general community via the internet.
